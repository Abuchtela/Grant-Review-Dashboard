# Grant-Review-Dashboard

It has been a while since Gitcoin DAO and the public good defendoors have recognised the importance and neccesity of the development of automated tools that assist in the distribution of public goods. The Grant Review dashboard seeks to accelerate the automation of grant reviews thus empowering grant owners to manage and analyze the grant applications in a more resource efficient way. Luckily the ODC has created the Sandbox initiative, thus people that have a passion for defending public goods have organized themselves to start this project independently. The project is open for contribution and accepts other members if they are interested in our work.

- Created from the [sandbox team proposal](https://forum.opendatacommunity.org/t/sandbox-team-proposal/30/2)

### What is it:  

An open source dashboard that aims to automatically screens grants by using a series of Legoâ€™s analysis on grants that participate in Gitcoin Rounds.

### Objective:  

The project aims to build a modular, configurable open source dashboard that will assist round owners by automatically screening grant applications in the Gitcoin rounds and detecting various proven suspicious/malicious behaviors. Over time we might also add functions that will also signal really good grant applications thus enabling almost instant approval for them.

### Who can use this:  

 By using this tool the round owners save time and resources by screening out bad grants from their rounds. Grantees benefit also because by filtering out bad grant applications they get more matching allocated to them.

This is an open source project, so everyone can use it, but please, check our license.
